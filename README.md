# Lambda-Function-Mediacal-Intelligence
Automated medical billing and coding

## Objective:
Lambda Function Medical Intelligence (LambdaMedIntel)  is an AI-Powered Robotic Process Automation (RPA). LambdaMedIntel solution on AI technologies like Deep Learning using Computer vision (CNN), optical character recognition (OCR), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP).
After been trained on large datasets of medical terminology, Lambda Function Medical Intelligence (LambdaMedIntel) automated the billing and coding process by analyzing physician documentation from the text of clinical records and automatically identifies the proper billing codes and then triggers an action in the Accounts Payable (AP) system without human interaction.
